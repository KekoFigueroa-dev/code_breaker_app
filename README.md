# Code Breaker App

A Python app that encodes and decodes secret messages using frequency analysis from two key texts.  
The "keys" are actual paragraphs from *A Game of Thrones* (ASOIAF Book 1), making your cipher as epic as Westeros itself.

## How it works

- The app analyzes the letter frequency of two hardcoded paragraphs from the book.
- When you encode, each letter in your message is swapped for a letter in the second paragraph, based on frequency order.
- Decoding reverses the process.
- Enter your message, choose encode or decode, and get your result instantly.

## Why a sword?

Crack the code, and you’re rewarded with a sword—just like a true lord or lady of the North!

## Usage

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `python codebreaker.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to encode or decode your message.

## Credits

Key phrases are excerpts from *A Game of Thrones* by George R. R. Martin.
